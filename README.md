# ðŸ“‘ Luz - Language Specification
### Description
This document details the key philosophy and rationale behind designing Luz, a general-purpose scripting language constructed as a dialect on top of Lua, a lightweight embeddable scripting language.

### Key Motivation
The motivation behind developing Luz as a distinct superset of Lua is derived from its minimal syntax, as well as the emphasis on reflective and metaprogramming features, making it incredibly flexible and expressive.
