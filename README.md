# ☄️ Blueprint & roadmap for Kuiper
Kuiper is a superset of Lua 5.1, using a modular transpiler to yield Lua 5.1 for the KuiperBelt JIT runtime, an adapted version of LuaJIT. Kuiper is an augmentation of Lua and is forward- & reverse-compatible with existing Lua 5.1 scripts. This repository details the key philosophy and roadmap for Kuiper's minimal syntax.

### Key Motivation
The motivation behind developing Kuiper as a modern dialect of Lua with functional and metaprogramming features at its core, while maintaining minimalism, flexibility and expression.
Kuiper implements modern concurrency support via coroutines, gradual typing with type definitions, pattern matching, improved lambda syntax and pipelining.

### Motivation for Kuiper Developlent 
- Kuiper fuses Lua and modern languages, i.e. TypeScript, Go and Elixir while preserving Lua's concise and small syntax. Kuiper resolves Lua's weaknesses by expanding on existing strengths through metaprogramming to maintain modernity and create a drive for general-purpose programming with Lua's syntax

- Lua's competitors, i.e. Ruby, Python, et cetera typically sacrifice simplicity and runtime minimalism through high-level abstractions, i.e. classes, inheritance, and larger runtime dependencies. In Kuiper, modern theories assist to soothe developer grievances as well as provide a lightning-fast scripting platform with small modular libraries and an updated memory management model.
